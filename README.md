## 🚀 Project Overview

NASA has performed biology experiments in space for decades, generating a massive amount of scientific papers.  
However, this information is often too dense and technical for the general public to understand.

**Bio Sciences Dashboard** solves this by using AI to summarize and explain space biology knowledge in plain language.

## 🧠 How It Works

1. **Scraper** – Collects and downloads NASA’s bioscience publications.  
2. **Vector Database** – Stores and indexes the papers for semantic search.  
3. **Agentic RAG System (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)** – Finds the most relevant content and feeds it to an AI model.  
4. **GPT Model Integration** – Generates natural, accurate, and easy-to-read answers.  
5. **Frontend Interface** – Allows users to ask questions, view related sources, and explore the original papers.
